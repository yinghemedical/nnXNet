# nnX-Net: An Extensible Multi-task Learning Framework for Medical Imaging

This repository will be updated with nnX-Net and related papers in the future. The nnX-Net project originates from the solution for the RSNA Intracranial Aneurysm Detection competition. The solution write-up is available at: [RSNA2025 2nd-place-solution](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/rsna-intracranial-aneurysm-detection/writeups/2nd-place-solution), and the competition code repository can be found at: [RSNA2025_Intracranial-Aneurysm-Detection](https://github.com/PengchengShi1220/RSNA2025_Intracranial-Aneurysm-Detection).

## Acknowledgements
